## 🧠 Design Guidelines for UI Changes

These are the visual and UX principles to follow when editing or generating any frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS, Rails views):

### ✅ General Rules
- **Keep it simple and clean** — avoid overcomplicated or overly creative layouts unless specifically requested.
- All changes should feel **native** to the existing design — no "clever" surprises.

### 📐 Layout
- Favor **vertical rhythm** and spacing.
- Use consistent padding (`p-4`, `p-6`) and rounded corners (`rounded-2xl` when appropriate).
- Responsive behavior should follow Tailwind's mobile-first approach.

### ⚠️ What Not To Do
- ❌ Don’t introduce new fonts or external style libraries.
- ❌ Don’t use inline styles.
- ❌ Don’t implement unexpected animations or layouts unless they serve a clear UX purpose.
